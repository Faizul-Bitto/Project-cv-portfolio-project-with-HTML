        <ul>
          <li>
            Led a team of four to develop GreenCycle, a full-stack mobile
            application connecting waste producers, collectors, and recyclers to
            promote eco-friendly waste management in Bangladesh.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and implemented the backend infrastructure using Laravel,
            developing RESTful APIs and managing secure database operations with
            MySQL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Structured the application following MVC principles and aimed to
            follow clean coding practices to ensure clarity and maintainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborated closely with cross-functional teammates to deliver a
            functional MVP.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a machine learning pipeline for predicting ODI match
            scores and win probabilities with up to 99% R² accuracy using
            advanced regression models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, Gradient
            Boosting, and LGBM.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engineered key features such as toss outcome, venue attributes, last
            5-over performance, and team statistics, improving prediction
            accuracy over baseline models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conducted comprehensive preprocessing, feature extraction, and
            hyperparameter tuning across models to optimize performance (XGBoost
            MAE: 2.8, RMSE: 7.1).
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated the final model into a mobile app (CrickPred) using Flask
            API (backend) and Flutter (frontend) to provide real-time match
            predictions to users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created interactive data visualizations (histograms, pie charts,
            heatmaps) to support insights and improve model interpretability.
